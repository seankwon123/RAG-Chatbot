GOOD:

1. What is Bitovi's latest blog post about?
2. Give me a summary about the most recent blog post.


3. How many articles does Bitovi have about AI?
4. how many articles about cloud architecture?

5. What articles can tell me about CI/CD pipelines?
6. Show some articles about cloud architecture
7. Can you show me all Bitovi articles about DevOps?


8. what kind of tools are recommended for cloud development?
9. What kind of tools does Bitovi recommend for E2E testing?
10. What kind of approaches should be used for AI architecture?



TODO:
"show me posts about..." (way less output) "show me articles about..." (way more output) give different output layouts
 - posts / articles should be the same meaning, I want both to show what comes up for "articles"
 - What made them different outputs, and why was "posts" stricter?


"Show me all Bitovi articles about DevOps"
    ugly output on "all" keyword - make this say "here is a list of sources to all about ____" 
                                - and have the exact "sources" output it has currently

if i use side button click for first prompt, it is duplicated 

get rid of search mode

Not Working / suspicious:




"What is the earliest post in the blog?"

"can you show me the five most recent bitovi posts?"
    only gives the most recent

things about authors
