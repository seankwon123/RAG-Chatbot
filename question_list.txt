Notes:
RESOLVED - "show me posts about..." (way less output) "show me articles about..." (way more output) give different output layouts
 - posts / articles should be the same meaning, I want both to show what comes up for "articles"
 - What made them different outputs, and why was "posts" stricter?
        “articles” matched your explicit route and printed every keyword hit.
        “posts” missed the regex, so it fell through to the hybrid (semantic + LLM) branch, which deliberately returns fewer items.
 - “posts” and “articles” are synonyms now 




Not Working:


"What is the earliest post in the blog?"

"can you show me the five most recent bitovi posts?"
    only gives the most recent
