GOOD:

"What is the most recent blog about?"
"What is the most recent blog?"
"Give me a summary about the most recent blog post."
"What articles can tell me about CI/CD pipelines?"
"How many articles does Bitovi have about AI?"
"Show some articles about cloud architecture"
"how many articles about cloud architecture?"
"what kind of tools are recommended for cloud development?"
"What kind of tools does Bitovi recommend for E2E testing?"



TODO:
"show me posts about..." (way less output)
"show me articles about..." (way better output) give different output layouts, make these same
 - posts / articles should be the same meaning
 - What made them different outputs, and why was "posts" stricter?


"Show me all Bitovi articles about DevOps"
    ugly output on "all" keyword - make this say "here is a list of sources to all about ____" 
                                - and have the exact "sources" output it has currently




Not Working / suspicious:


"Show articles about cloud architecture"
    Only shows 1 articles about node.js, maybe show some with keyword cloud, architecture?







"What is the earliest post in the blog?"

"can you show me the five most recent bitovi posts?"
    only gives the most recent

----------------


"What is the second latest post in the blog?"
    gives first




"How many authors are there?"
    can't find anything
