Working:

"What is the most recent blog about?"
"What is the most recent blog?"
"Give me a summary about the most recent blog post."
"What articles can tell me about CI/CD pipelines?"
"How many articles does Bitovi have about AI?"
"Show some articles about cloud architecture"
"how many articles about cloud architecture?"
"what kind of tools are recommended for cloud development?"






Not Working / suspicious:


"What kind of tools does Bitovi recommend for E2E testing?"
    this should show at least "Testing Angular Applications End-to-End (E2E) with Cypress" and maybe things that match e2e or testing keywords? if it's not already doing that

"Show articles about cloud architecture"
    Only shows 1 articles about node.js, maybe show some with keyword cloud, architecture?


"Show me all Bitovi articles about DevOps"
    ugly output





"What is the earliest post in the blog?"

"can you show me the five most recent bitovi posts?"
    only gives the most recent

----------------


"What is the second latest post in the blog?"
    gives first




"How many authors are there?"
    can't find anything
